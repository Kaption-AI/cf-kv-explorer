# Cloudflare KV Explorer - Project Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

I have successfully implemented the complete Cloudflare KV Explorer application according to all your specifications.

## 🚀 What's Been Built

### Core Application
- **Modern React + TypeScript application** with Vite build system
- **SHADCN UI components** for beautiful, accessible interface
- **Intelligent pattern detection algorithm** that scans KV keys and detects patterns like:
  - `account:1234` → `account:{id}`
  - `client:123` → `client:{id}` 
  - `link:123:1234` → `link:{id}:{id}`

### Key Features
1. **API Key Input** - Secure credential management
2. **Tree Explorer** - Left sidebar with namespace and pattern navigation
3. **JSON Editor** - Edit KV values with syntax highlighting and validation
4. **Table View** - Browse multiple keys in tabular format
5. **Local Testing Mode** - No Cloudflare account needed for testing

### Testing & Development
- **Wrangler integration** for local KV development
- **Puppeteer E2E tests** for automated testing
- **Local API mock** with sample data for testing
- **Production build** successfully generates optimized assets

### Documentation
- **All prompts stored** in `prompts/` folder as requested
- **Comprehensive README** with usage instructions
- **Complete documentation** of architecture and features

## 🎯 How to Use
